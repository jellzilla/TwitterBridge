Assignment
----------
15 - 30 minute light show on the Pausch Bridge

Working Title
-------------
???

Idea
----
We conceptualize the Pausch bridge as a communal canvas. During our
light show, passers by can paint the bridge to their liking using a quick,
intuitive, exciting mobile interface. When just one person interacts with
the bridge, they experience the thrill of controlling a
larger-than-human-scale architectural element. As a greater number of users
become active, their individual commands fade into a blended communal landscape.

Functional Design
-----------------
When our show starts,
  the bridge will Tweet hello.

During our show,
  users may change *attributes* of the bridge with specific *commands*;
  users may interact with the bridge via Twitter;
  the bridge will interact with its users via Twitter;
  multiple users may share control of the bridge, in that
    the bridge will split its display evenly among them;
  the bridge will pulsate beckoningly when no one is interacting with it and its queue is empty.

When our show is not running,
  users' Twitter requests are queued to be played back later.

When our show ends,
  the bridge will Tweet goodbye.
